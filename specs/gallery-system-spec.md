- Optimized image sizes for different screen resolutions
- Lazy loading for masonry gallery view

### Data Integration
- **PayloadCMS Integration**: Gallery items managed through GalleryItem collection
- **Image Processing**: Sharp integration for optimized image delivery
- **Dynamic Loading**: Async image fetching with `getGalleryImages('human'|'non-human')`
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with defined interfaces

### Responsive Design
- **Desktop**: Full-screen horizontal navigation with progress bar
- **Mobile**: Vertical swipe navigation with masonry overview
- **Breakpoint**: 768px threshold for mobile/desktop switching
- **Touch Optimization**: Minimum 44px touch targets

## User Interface

### Desktop Gallery Experience
1. User enters gallery page
2. Full-screen immersive layout loads
3. Header with gallery title and cross-navigation link
4. Horizontal image navigation via wheel/keyboard
5. Auto-hiding progress bar at bottom
6. Escape key returns to main site

### Mobile Gallery Experience
1. User enters gallery page
2. Large single image view with touch navigation
3. Image counter and navigation buttons
4. Swipe gestures for previous/next navigation
5. Masonry overview accessible after last image
6. Back button from masonry to single image view

### Gallery Navigation Flow
Human Gallery Page
├── Desktop: Full-screen horizontal scroll
├── Mobile: Touch navigation + masonry
└── Cross-link to Non-Human Gallery
Non-Human Gallery Page
├── Desktop: Full-screen horizontal scroll
├── Mobile: Touch navigation + masonry
└── Cross-link to Human Gallery

## Data Requirements

### Current Implementation Analysis
```typescript
// Existing gallery data structure
interface GalleryImage {
  url: string
  alt: string
  width: number
  height: number
}

// PayloadCMS integration
interface PayloadGalleryItem {
  id: string
  image: PayloadImage
}
```

## Component Architecture

### Current Component Structure

## API Endpoints
- `getGalleryImages(category: 'human' | 'non-human')` - Fetch categorized gallery images
- Integration with PayloadCMS Media collection for image management

## Image Requirements
- **Formats**: WebP with JPEG fallback
- **Sizes**: Multiple responsive sizes generated by Sharp
- **Alt Text**: Required for accessibility compliance
- **Optimization**: Progressive loading and compression

## Acceptance Criteria

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Human and non-human galleries display correctly on all devices
- [ ] Smooth transitions without performance issues
- [ ] Touch navigation works intuitively on mobile
- [ ] Keyboard navigation supports all standard keys
- [ ] Loading states provide clear feedback
- [ ] Cross-gallery navigation maintains context
- [ ] Accessibility standards met (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Error handling gracefully manages failed image loads
- [ ] Typography and spacing match design specifications

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Component rendering, navigation functions, data fetching
- **Integration Tests**: Gallery switching, image loading, responsive behavior
- **Performance Tests**: Image loading times, transition smoothness
- **Mobile Tests**: Touch gestures, swipe navigation, masonry view
- **Accessibility Tests**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility
- **Cross-browser Tests**: Modern browser compatibility

## Implementation Notes

### Current Strengths
- ✅ Sophisticated responsive detection with debounced resize handling
- ✅ Complex desktop navigation with wheel, touch, and keyboard support
- ✅ Mobile-optimized masonry view for gallery overview
- ✅ Smooth transition timing with proper state management
- ✅ TypeScript integration with well-defined interfaces
- ✅ PayloadCMS integration for content management

### Areas for Improvement During Vertical Slice Migration
- **Custom Hooks**: Extract navigation logic into reusable hooks
- **State Management**: Centralize gallery state for better maintainability
- **Error Boundaries**: Add comprehensive error handling
- **Performance**: Implement virtual scrolling for large galleries
- **Accessibility**: Enhanced ARIA labels and focus management

### Migration Strategy
1. **Create gallery-management slice** with existing components
2. **Extract custom hooks** for device detection and navigation
3. **Centralize data fetching** in slice utilities
4. **Add comprehensive error handling** and loading states
5. **Enhance accessibility** features
6. **Optimize performance** with virtual scrolling if needed

### Technical Constraints
- **PayloadCMS Dependency**: Gallery content managed through CMS
- **Image Processing**: Sharp dependency for optimization
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- **Touch Support**: Requires modern touch event APIs
- **Performance**: Large image collections may impact memory usage
