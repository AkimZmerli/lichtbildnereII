              My name is Valentin Mici. Born in Romania, raised in Gelenau, and since 2014, I have
              been living in Chemnitz, which has now become my home. For the past five years, I have
              been deeply dedicated to black-and-white photography and the development process in
              the photo lab. I consciously chose against commissioned photography because I prefer
              to shape my work freely and independentlyâ€”in every sense.

              Discovering photography as a means of expression fills me with enthusiasm, as it gives
              me the opportunity to influence my work. Not only at the moment I press the shutter
              button but also in the photo lab, where I have the freedom to further refine my ideas
              until the result matches my vision. I am open towards cooperation. Some of my photos
              are for sale.
