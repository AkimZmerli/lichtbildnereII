## About This Project

This portfolio platform showcases photography and multimedia exhibitions through immersive 3D and video experiences. What makes it special isn't just the technology—it's how it was built using modern agentic engineering techniques.

**Built by a junior developer with AI as co-pilot**, this project demonstrates the incredible potential of modern agentic AI in software development. Every component, every architectural decision, and every line of documentation represents a collaboration between human creativity and AI precision.

### The Story Behind the Code

As a junior developer taking on my very first major project, I embarked on an ambitious journey to create a professional-grade portfolio platform. Rather than struggle alone with complex architectural decisions, I partnered with AI assistants—particularly **Claude Code**—to transform ideas into reality.

This project leverages **agentic engineering techniques** that give AI assistants significant technical advantages:

**Four-Folder AI Structure**: The project implements a specialized `/AI` directory containing `.claude`, `.tasks`, `.specs`, and `.docs` folders (later consolidated into a unified `/ai` structure). This organizational pattern provides AI assistants with:
- **Contextual Understanding**: Clear project boundaries and technical specifications
- **Operational Guidance**: Task management and workflow definitions  
- **Knowledge Base**: Comprehensive documentation and architectural decisions
- **Collaboration Framework**: Structured environment for human-AI development workflows

**PayloadCMS as Technical Foundation**: The choice of PayloadCMS as the backend provides unique advantages for AI-assisted development:
- **Type-Safe API Generation**: Automatic REST and GraphQL endpoint creation with TypeScript definitions
- **Declarative Configuration**: Collection definitions that AI can understand and modify systematically
- **Schema-First Development**: Clear data models that enable AI to make informed architectural decisions

**The Result**:
- **15-minute complete architecture migration** (Vertical Slice Architecture) executed by Claude Code
- **Enterprise-level documentation** generated and refined by AI assistants
- **Production-ready codebase** with modern best practices implemented systematically
- **Sophisticated animations** and user interactions built through AI-human collaboration

This isn't just a portfolio—it's a testament to what's possible when human ambition meets AI capability through proper agentic engineering practices.

│   ├── components/       # UI components
│   ├── hooks/           # React hooks
│   ├── services/        # Business logic
│   └── types/           # TypeScript definitions
├── video-showcase/      # Video streaming feature
├── social-book/         # Interactive book feature
└── shared/             # Cross-cutting concerns
    └── ui/             # Reusable components
```
