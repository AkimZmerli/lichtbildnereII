# Social Book Specification

## Overview
3D flip book implementation that transforms an existing PDF into an interactive digital book with realistic page-turning animations. The system must provide smooth page flipping effects, maintain PDF layout integrity, and integrate seamlessly with the existing tech stack without watermarks or intrusive branding.

## User Stories
- As a visitor, I want to browse the social book with realistic page-turning so that I experience it like a physical book
- As a user, I want smooth page flipping animations so that the interaction feels natural and engaging
- As a mobile user, I want touch-friendly page navigation that works on any device
- As a visitor, I want to see the original PDF layout without distortion so that content displays as intended
- As an exhibition visitor, I want an immersive reading experience without distracting interface elements

## Functional Requirements

- [ ] PDF-to-flipbook conversion maintaining original layout
- [ ] Touch/swipe navigation for page turning
- [ ] Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- [ ] Clean interface without third-party watermarks or branding
- [ ] Fast loading with progressive page rendering
- [ ] Seamless integration with Next.js application
- [ ] High-quality page rendering that preserves PDF fidelity

### Should Have
- [ ] Zoom functionality for detailed viewing
- [ ] Keyboard navigation (arrow keys, space bar)
- [ ] Fullscreen reading mode
- [ ] Page thumbnails for quick navigation
- [ ] Loading states during book initialization
- [ ] Auto-flip timing options

### Could Have
- [ ] Bookmark functionality for favorite pages
- [ ] Search within book content
- [ ] Share specific pages
- [ ] Print individual pages
- [ ] Multiple book collections
- [ ] Reading progress tracking

## Technical Requirements

### Critical Implementation Constraints
- **No Watermarks**: Must be completely brandable/white-label
- **No Layout Distortion**: PDF pages must render with original proportions
- **No Intrusive Navigation**: Minimal UI that doesn't compete with content
- **Smooth 3D Animation**: Hardware-accelerated page turning at 60fps
- **Clean Integration**: Works within existing Next.js/React architecture

### Performance Requirements
- Book must load and display first page within 3 seconds
- Page turning animations at consistent 60fps
- Progressive loading of pages for large PDFs
- Optimized memory usage for mobile devices
- Smooth performance on older mobile devices

### Integration Requirements
- **Framework**: Compatible with Next.js/React
- **Styling**: Customizable with Tailwind CSS classes
- **Assets**: PDF hosted via existing media pipeline
- **Responsive**: Works across all device breakpoints

## Software Solution Evaluation Criteria

### Essential Features
- [ ] PDF-to-flipbook conversion capability
- [ ] High-quality 3D page turning animation
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design
- [ ] White-label/brandable (no watermarks)
- [ ] React/Next.js compatibility
- [ ] Customizable styling and layout

### Deal-Breakers
- ❌ Forced watermarks or branding
- ❌ Page distortion or aspect ratio changes
- ❌ Poor mobile performance
- ❌ Intrusive default navigation/UI
- ❌ Requires external hosting
- ❌ No customization options

### Evaluation Matrix

Solution Options to Research:
├── FlipHTML5 (React integration?)
├── PageFlip.js (open source)
├── Turn.js alternatives
├── PDF.js + custom 3D CSS
├── Three.js custom solution
└── Commercial React flipbook libraries

## User Interface

### Reading Experience
1. User navigates to social book page
2. PDF loads with realistic book appearance
3. Clean, minimal interface with subtle page turning hints
4. Touch/swipe or click page edges to turn pages
5. Smooth 3D flip animation reveals next page
6. All navigation controls auto-hide during reading

### Navigation Controls
- **Primary**: Touch/click page edges for turning
- **Secondary**: Swipe gestures on mobile
- **Keyboard**: Arrow keys for desktop users
- **Optional**: Minimal page counter or progress indicator

## Data Requirements

### PDF Management
```typescript
interface SocialBook {
 id: string
 title: string
 pdfUrl: string
 pageCount: number
 thumbnailUrl?: string
 isActive: boolean
 description?: string
}
```
### Integration Strategy 

```typescript
// Preferred component structure
<FlipBook
  pdfUrl="/path/to/social-book.pdf"
  className="custom-styling"
  showControls={false}
  enableTouch={true}
  responsive={true}
/>
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### Definition of Done
- [ ] PDF displays as realistic 3D flip book
- [ ] Page turning animations are smooth and natural
- [ ] No visible watermarks or third-party branding
- [ ] Original PDF layout preserved without distortion
- [ ] Touch navigation works intuitively on all devices
- [ ] Book loads quickly and performs well on mobile
- [ ] Integration with existing site architecture is seamless
- [ ] Customizable styling matches site design

### Testing Requirements
- **Performance Tests**: Loading time and animation smoothness
- **Device Tests**: Functionality across mobile/tablet/desktop
- **PDF Tests**: Layout preservation and rendering quality
- **Integration Tests**: Compatibility with existing tech stack
- **User Tests**: Intuitive navigation and reading experience

## Implementation Notes

### Solution Selection Criteria
- Open source preferred for full customization control
- Commercial solutions acceptable if truly white-label
- Must support modern React/Next.js patterns
- Should leverage CSS 3D transforms for performance
- Mobile-first responsive design essential

### Fallback Strategy
If no suitable 3D solution found:
- Enhanced PDF viewer with custom page transitions
- CSS-only flip animations as intermediate solution
- Canvas-based custom implementation as last resort
