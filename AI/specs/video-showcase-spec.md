## Data Requirements

### Video Content Structure
```typescript
interface VideoContent {
  slug: string                    // URL identifier (e.g., "zwoelftausend")
  title: string                   // Display title
  muxPlaybackId: string          // Mux video identifier
  description?: string           // Optional video description
  duration?: number              // Video length in seconds
  thumbnailUrl?: string          // Video poster image
  isActive: boolean              // Whether video is publicly viewable
  relatedExhibition?: string     // Link to main exhibition content
  metaDescription?: string       // SEO description
}
```
### PayloadCMS Collection

// Suggested VideoContent collection
{
  slug: { type: 'text', unique: true, required: true }
  title: { type: 'text', required: true }
  muxPlaybackId: { type: 'text', required: true }
  description: { type: 'richText' }
  thumbnailImage: { type: 'upload', relationTo: 'media' }
  isActive: { type: 'checkbox', defaultValue: true }
  relatedExhibition: { type: 'relationship', relationTo: 'exhibitions' }
}

## Constraints
- **Mux Dependency**: Relies on external streaming service
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers with Web Components support

### Component Issues to Address
```typescript
// Current component naming inconsistency
export default function DisplayScan() // Should be VideoShowcase or MuxVideoPlayer
```

// File location suggests multiple purposes
// Should be in video-showcase feature slice

## Migration Strategy for Vertical Slice

Current: src/app/(frontend)/zwoelftausend/page.tsx
Target:  src/features/video-showcase/
├── components/
│   ├── VideoShowcase.tsx      # Renamed from DisplayScan
│   ├── MuxVideoPlayer.tsx     # Extracted player logic
│   └── VideoControls.tsx      # Custom control components
├── hooks/
│   ├── useMuxPlayer.ts        # Dynamic loading logic
│   └── useVideoAnalytics.ts   # Tracking and metrics
├── types/
│   └── video.ts               # Video content interfaces
├── utils/
│   └── muxPlayerLoader.ts     # Component loading utilities
└── index.ts                   # Public API exports`

### Enhancement Opportunities
- **Generalization**: Convert from hardcoded to CMS-driven content
- **Component Naming**: Rename `DisplayScan` to `VideoShowcase` for clarity
- **Error States**: Enhanced error handling and fallback content
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during Mux Player initialization
