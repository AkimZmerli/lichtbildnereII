## Technical Debt

### üìã Generic Component Names
**Severity**: Low  
**Found**: During codebase analysis  
**Description**: Components have generic names (Hero.tsx, About.tsx) that don't indicate business purpose  
**Impact**: Makes AI collaboration difficult, unclear component responsibilities  
**Proposed Solution**: Rename components during vertical slice migration  
**Priority**: Address during slice restructuring

### üìã Missing Component Documentation
**Severity**: Medium  
**Found**: During codebase analysis  
**Description**: No JSDoc comments on components, unclear prop types and usage  
**Impact**: AI cannot understand component purpose and proper usage  
**Proposed Solution**: Add comprehensive JSDoc during slice migration  
**Priority**: High - include in slice migration tasks

### üìã Mixed Concerns in Components
**Severity**: Medium  
**Found**: During codebase analysis  
**Description**: Some components handle both data fetching and UI rendering  
**Impact**: Unclear boundaries, harder to test and maintain  
**Proposed Solution**: Separate data logic into custom hooks during refactoring  
**Priority**: Medium - address after initial slice structure

## Codebase Quality Issues

### üìã No Test Coverage
**Severity**: High  
**Found**: Project analysis  
**Description**: Zero test files found in entire codebase  
**Impact**: No safety net for refactoring, difficult to ensure reliability  
**Proposed Solution**: Add testing infrastructure during slice setup  
**Priority**: High - critical for safe refactoring

### üìã Inconsistent File Naming
**Severity**: Low  
**Found**: During structure analysis  
**Description**: Mixed naming conventions (kebab-case folders, PascalCase files)  
**Impact**: Cognitive overhead, inconsistent patterns  
**Proposed Solution**: Establish naming conventions in vertical slice structure  
**Priority**: Medium - address during migration
