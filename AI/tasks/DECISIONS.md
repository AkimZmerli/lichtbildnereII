# Technical Decisions Log

## Purpose
Record important technical decisions made during development. Each decision should include context, options considered, chosen solution, and reasoning.

## 2025-01-XX - Architecture Decisions

### Decision: Four-Folder AI Documentation Structure
**Context**: Need organized documentation for AI collaboration  
**Options Considered**:
- Three-folder system (docs/, specs/, tasks/)
- Traditional documentation approach
- No structured documentation
**Decision**: Four folders (.claude/, docs/, specs/, tasks/)  
**Reasoning**: 
- Separates AI-specific instructions from general project docs
- Clear separation of concerns (behavior, knowledge, requirements, work)
- Better than three-folder because AI behavior is distinct from project knowledge
**Impact**: Foundation for all future AI collaboration

### Decision: Vertical Slice Architecture
**Context**: Current horizontal layers make AI collaboration difficult  
**Options Considered**:
- Keep existing horizontal structure (components/, hooks/, lib/)
- Traditional feature folders
- Vertical slice by business capability
**Decision**: Vertical slice architecture  
**Reasoning**:
- Aligns with business capabilities (gallery, exhibition, social book)
- Easier for AI to understand feature boundaries
- Self-contained slices reduce cognitive load
- Better long-term maintainability
**Impact**: Complete codebase restructuring required

### Decision: Gallery Management as First Slice
**Context**: Need to choose which feature to migrate first  
**Options Considered**:
- Portfolio showcase (most visible)
- Gallery management (most isolated)
- Exhibition features (most unique)
**Decision**: Gallery management slice first  
**Reasoning**:
- Most isolated business logic
- Clear boundaries (human/non-human categorization)
- Well-defined scope
- Good learning opportunity for slice pattern
**Impact**: Template for all other slice migrations
