# Simple Deployment Guide - 250MB Media

Since your media is only 250MB, here's the **easiest and cheapest** approach:

## Option 1: Vercel Blob Storage (RECOMMENDED)
**Cost: ~$0-5/month for 250MB**
**Setup: Automatic in Vercel**

### Steps:
1. **In Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Go to your project → Storage tab
   - Click "Create Database" → Select "Blob"
   - It automatically creates `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`

2. **Add Neon Database Variables:**
   ```
   POSTGRES_HOST=<from-neon-dashboard>
   POSTGRES_PORT=5432
   POSTGRES_DB=<your-database>
   POSTGRES_USER=<your-user>
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<your-password>
   PAYLOAD_SECRET=<generate-random-string>
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL=https://your-site.vercel.app
   ```

3. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Configure Vercel Blob storage"
   git push origin main
   ```

That's it! Media uploads will work automatically.

## Option 2: Store in Git Repository (FREE but not recommended)
- Simply commit images to `/public/uploads`
- No external storage needed
- Free but makes repo larger

## Option 3: Keep Cloudflare R2 (if already set up)
**Cost: ~$0.015/GB/month = basically free for 250MB**
- Only if you already have R2 configured
- Overkill for 250MB

## Why Vercel Blob?
- **Zero configuration** - Vercel handles everything
- **Integrated** - Works perfectly with Vercel deployments
- **Cheap** - First 1GB is practically free
- **Fast** - CDN included automatically
- **No CORS issues** - Same origin as your app

## Quick Checklist:
✅ Vercel Blob storage configured in code
✅ Neon database ready
✅ Environment variables template created
✅ Ready to deploy

Just create the Blob store in Vercel dashboard and you're done!
