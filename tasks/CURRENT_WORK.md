### ðŸ”„ AI-Friendly Architecture Setup
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Goal**: Transform repo to vertical slice architecture optimized for AI collaboration  
**Current Step**: Setting up documentation folders and initial content  
**Next Actions**:
- [ ] Populate all four folders (.claude/, docs/, specs/, tasks/) with initial content
- [ ] Test AI workflow with Claude Code
- [ ] Identify first slice to migrate (likely gallery-management)

## Notes & Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- Chose vertical slice over horizontal layers for better AI collaboration
- Four-folder documentation structure for clear separation of concerns
- Gallery management identified as first slice to migrate (most isolated)

### AI Workflow Notes
- Claude Code works better with simple, focused prompts
- Need to avoid empty .md files (causes API errors)
- Reference documentation explicitly in prompts
